## How to Use


## Limitation
The webpage is a very simplified version as it's just a place to dilever the classification result and ideas. The key part of this project is the classification based on the text data and the web page is just a sample model of the real world scenario. The data used in this project is a small set. In real world as the data scales, the efficiency of the classification may vary.
