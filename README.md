# Cuisine Classifier using Text Mining

## Overview
Digital news articles has become part and parcel of our lives, heavily used by people to fetch information, express opinions, judgement on any kind of topics. Utilizing the large scale data from these platforms extensively benefits in determining the solutions.
The lack of system to classify and filter the set of food related articles makes it challenging for users find the desired articles. 

In this project, we have built a classifier model which will classify the food receipies into different cuisines based on the ingredients used. 

we have also bulit a web interface to filter and view the classified results and also to act as a interface to navigate to the source food receipe article page.

## How to Use


## Limitation
The webpage is a very simplified version as it's just a place to dilever the classification result and ideas. The key part of this project is the classification based on the text data and the web page is just a sample model of the real world scenario. The data used in this project is a small set. In real world as the data scales, the efficiency of the classification may vary.
